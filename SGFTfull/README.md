# SGFT Full
This is the full version of Scanning Gradient / Fourier Transform for striation quantification

For most cases, the 'lite' version, which quantifies uniformity of striations, will serve the needed purposes.  This version includes functions and outputs focuses more on striation strength and locations containing "high-strength" striations.
